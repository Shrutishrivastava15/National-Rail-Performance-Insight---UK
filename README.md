# National-Rail-Performance-Insight---UK
Maven Rail Challenge , In this project, I acted as a BI Developer for National Rail, focusing on creating an interactive dashboard to provide valuable insights for passenger train operators in England, Scotland, and Wales.  Here are some of the key goals I achieved:
Identify the most popular routes
Determine peak travel times
Analyze revenue from different ticket types & classes
Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors
Using Power BI's dynamic features and powerful analytics, I transformed complex rail data into actionable insights. These insights will drive informed decision-making and ultimately enhance the passenger experience.
